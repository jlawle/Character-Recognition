# Optical character recognition in ppm images
Program implements matched spatial filtering (MSF) to select characters from a given ppm image. The program outputs true and false positives and negatives to verify the accuracy of character recognition against a ground truth file.


    This program provides concepts of understanding:
    - Zero mean center calculation
    - Convolution across a ppm image
    - Normalization techniques
    - Result analyzation via ROC curve
